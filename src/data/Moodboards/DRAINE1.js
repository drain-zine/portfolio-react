This led to the heavy incorporation of graphic assets and backgrounds on sites, which was coupled with the increased use of bright primary and secondary colours, providing an element of contrast against chromatically busy pages. This was particularly popular among hobbyist and amateur websites, allowing one to create a unique site and potentially show off their own design work. Some elements of this practice were utilised in professional websites, specifically “themed” websites meant to promote products such as games, film and tv or to exist alongside these products as guides or the blossoming “wiki” site.',
