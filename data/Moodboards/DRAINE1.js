        text_1: 'Drain Edition 1 design inspiration came from the cultural magazine 032c. The 032c schema utilised black bacgrounds with white text and accents, creating an easy to read, high contrast page. Red was also used for banners and flourishes, highlighting them on the otherwise duotone pages.',   
        text_2: 'For drain this schema was tweaked; taking the black background and white text however compressing the text into a central column 1/3 of the screen width. This emulated the look of a newspaper column, as well as enveloping the content in negative space creating a figure-ground relationship between text and the site as a whole, thus occupying the reader’s full frame of perception.',

        text_1: 'The 032c schema was further changed by implementing a pure RGB pallete for flourishes as opposed to only red. This added variation to the links of the site whilst still maintaining overall contrast, as well as further complementing the visual aesthetic of the site. Low-poly and 128bit colour clipart renders were used for link thumbnails, to further cement the main design cue of the choose-your-own-adventure. ARGs and DIY adventure websites, particularly those built on angelfire, were the main inspiration for this.',

        text_2: 'Another point of inspiration was the Alternate Reality Game (ARG) which has seen a surge of popularity in the earlier 2010s.

Some spill out into the real world too, sending players out into urban areas to find physical clues that will aid them in the puzzle. They are effective in instilling a sense of mystery within players, who will form communities dedicated to solving these challenges.',
        text_4: 'In the context of the zine, all articles were hidden across the site and accessed by going through the adventure. Each choice taken by the reader would lead them to a thematically linked article, giving just enough of a connection that a reader would be able to guess the subject or theme of the article that will be served to them.',

        text_5: 'This massively increased the website’s click through rate, with many readers going through every page to trace the adventure. This had the advantage that each article was also served to the reader, bypassing one’s natural tendency to heavily discriminate against content based on their headlines and thumbnails and offering them a chance to engage with articles they wouldn’t have otherwise.',
        text_6: 'The connecting narrative, distinctly fantasy in flavor, also aided in creating a strong visual language of the site. Using fantasy and clipart assets as touched upon earlier, as well as black negative space, created a very focused experience with both a unique textual and meta-textual mood.',
